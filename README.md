Some definitions
| Keyword        | Definition           | Notes  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Synchronous      | Each step happens in sequence | Nothing else can happen whilst executing a step (UI will block) |
| Asynchronous      | Sequence doesn't matter, so other work can continue interrupt it      |   UI won't lock, however it won't affect speed |
| Parallel | Steps will be executed together      |    Significantly reduces execution time |
